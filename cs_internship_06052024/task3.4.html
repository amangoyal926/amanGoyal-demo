    <!--Title tag-->
    <!--Title tags are used by search engines to determine the subject of a page and display it in SERP. In HTML, a title tag looks like this:-->
    <!--As a rule of thumb, titles that are under 60 characters long will fit on most screens.-->
    <!--Brands in title-->
    <!--In case you have a well-known brand, it is a good idea to use it in the title. When users skim the results page, they will be more likely to choose something they recognize.If you don’t have an established brand, you will not see any immediate benefit from including it in the title. But, it may help you to build brand recognition over time, so you will start seeing the benefits eventually.-->
    <title>task3.4</title>
    <!--Meta description tag-->
    <!--Meta description is a short paragraph of text used to describe your page in search results.-->
    <!--SEO values-->
    <!--The function of meta description is similar to the title. It provides a little more detail about your page and it helps users decide whether to visit your page or not.-->
    <!--There is no technical limit on the length of the meta description, but Google will generally show only the first 160 characters in your snippet-->
    <!--Meta description keywords-->
    <!--if my title is How to Choose the Best Laptop for Work, then in my description, instead of saying laptop for work I’ll say business laptops. This way I’m covering more ground and there is a better chance of matching the user’s query exactly.-->
    <meta name="description" content="Your description goes here">
    <!--Headings-->
    <!--Headings (H1-H6) are used to split your page into sections or chapters. Each heading is like a small title within the page.-->
    <!--The initial function of headings was to improve user experience. When the page is properly organized with headings, users have an easier time navigating the content, skipping irrelevant chapters, and finding the important stuff.-->
    <h1>This is the heading tag</h1>
    <!--HTML5 semantic tags-->
    <!--HTML5 semantic tags are a part of the latest HTML standard and are used to help search engines understand the content of the page and navigation.-->
    <!--HTML5 tags kind of replaced the traditional use of div’s for dividing pages into sections. Sure thing, div’s are still in use, but the latest HTML5 standard tags are much easier to understand, as they explicitly indicate what part means what. This makes your pages load faster, thus improving the overall PageSpeed performance score.-->

    <!--Most common HTML5 tags are <article> , <audio> , <details> , <header>, <footer> , <time> , <video> etc.-->
    <article>
        <h1>I am a heading 1</h1>    
        <p>I am the paragraph of the article.</p>    
    </article>
    <!--Alt attribute-->
    <!--Alt text plays a major role in image optimization. It makes your images accessible both to search engines (by telling them what a particular image means) and to people (by displaying an alternative text in case a particular image cannot be loaded or by helping screen readers convey images).-->
    <img src="url" alt="Your image description goes here">
    <!--Open graph tags-->
    <!--Open Graph (OG) tags are placed in the <head> section of a page and allow any webpage to become a rich object in social networks.OG tags let you control how the information about your page is represented when shared via social channels. This possibility may help you enhance the performance of your links on social media, thus driving more click-throughs and increasing conversions.-->
    <meta name="og:title" property="og:title" content="Your Open Graph Title Goes Here">    
    <!--Robots Tag-->
    <!--A robots tag is an element in the HTML of a page that informs search engines which pages on your site should be indexed and which should not.
    It is not that a robots tag may help you boost your rankings, but you can use it to save your rankings in case you have to block some pages from indexing.For example, you can have some pages with rather thin content that you don’t want to be indexed in search, but which you would like to keep. In this case, you can just add a noindex tag for this page.-->
    <meta name="robots" content="index, follow">
    <!--Canonical tag-->
    <!--When you have a few pages with identical content, you can use a canonical tag to tell search engines which page should be prioritized.-->
    <link href="URL" rel="canonical">
    <!--Hreflang tag-->
    <!--Hreflang is actually not a tag but an attribute. It’s used to tell Google that your pages are available in different languages and what URLs these pages can be found on. Besides, hreflang annotations help with country targeting, as they let Google understand where to show your page-->
    <link rel="alternate" hreflang="en-gb" href="https://example.com/en-gb/" />
    <!--Responsive Site meta tag-->
    <!--The responsive site meta tag is an essential piece of HTML that helps ensure your website looks good on all devices, from desktops to smartphones. This HTML SEO tag is particularly important in a world where browsing on mobile devices is incredibly common.-->
